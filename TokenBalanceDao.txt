The main purpose of the provided smart contract, named "Dao" (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization), in Solidity is to create 
and manage proposals within a decentralized voting system where users can vote using an ERC-20 token. This contract is designed to 
facilitate the following functionalities:

Proposal Creation: Users can create new proposals by calling the createProposal function, providing a description of the proposal. 
In addition to the description, users must specify an ERC-20 token address that will be used for voting on the proposal. The contract 
checks that the creator of the proposal has a balance of the specified token greater than zero.

Voting with ERC-20 Tokens: Users can vote on proposals by calling the voteOnProposal function, specifying the proposal ID and their vote 
(in favor or against the proposal). The contract checks whether the user has already voted on the proposal and whether they have a positive 
balance of the specified ERC-20 token to participate in the vote.

Vote Counting: The proposer of a proposal (the user who created it) can call the countVotes function to count the votes for a specific 
proposal. The result of the vote is determined based on the balance of the ERC-20 token held by users who voted in favor or against the 
proposal.

Proposal Information Retrieval: Users can retrieve information about a specific proposal using the getproposal_detail function, which 
returns details about the proposal, including the proposer, description, vote counts, and whether the proposal has passed.

In summary, this smart contract serves as a basic framework for a decentralized voting system within a DAO. It allows users to 
create proposals, vote on them using an ERC-20 token, and conduct vote counting to determine whether a proposal has passed or not. 
The contract provides transparency and automation for decision-making within the decentralized organization.
