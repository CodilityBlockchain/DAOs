Function of the smart contract are defined as follows:
Proposal Creation: Users can create new proposals by calling the createProposal function, providing a description of the proposal. 
Each proposal is assigned a unique identifier.

Voting: Users can vote on proposals by calling the vote function, specifying the proposal ID and their vote (in favor or against). 
Each user can vote only once on a specific proposal.

Vote Counting: The contract allows the proposer (the person who created the proposal) to call the countVotes function to count the 
votes for a specific proposal. Once the vote counting is conducted, the proposal's result is determined based 
on the majority of "yes" or "no" votes.

Proposal Information Retrieval: Users can retrieve information about a specific proposal using various getter functions, such as 
getProposalVotes, getVoteStatus, getResult, and getProposalDetails. These functions allow users to query the voting results, 
the status of individual votes, and the overall status of a proposal (open or closed).


In summary, this smart contract serves as a basic framework for a decentralized voting system, where members can create proposals, 
vote on them, and have the results counted in a transparent and automated manner. It can be used by decentralized organizations, 
communities, or groups that want to make collective decisions through a decentralized and trustless process.
