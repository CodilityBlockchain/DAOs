SpecialTokenDao has following features : 
The main purpose of the provided smart contract, named "VotingDAO," in Solidity is to facilitate the creation, management, and voting 
on proposals within a decentralized voting system, similar to the previous version. However, there is an important addition in this 
contract: it allows users to vote using a specific ERC-20 token as collateral. This means that users must have a balance of the specified 
ERC-20 token in order to participate in the voting process. Let's break down the main functionalities and purposes of this smart contract:

ERC-20 Token Integration: This version of the contract interfaces with an ERC-20 token through the IERC20 interface. Users can 
create proposals and vote on them by staking a specific ERC-20 token.

Proposal Creation: Users can create new proposals by calling the createProposal function, providing a description of the proposal and 
specifying the address of the ERC-20 token that will be used for voting.

Voting with ERC-20 Tokens: Users can vote on proposals by calling the vote function. However, in addition to checking whether a user has 
already voted, this version also checks if the user has a positive balance of the specified ERC-20 token. Users can only vote if they have tokens.

Vote Counting: The countVotes function allows the proposer (the person who created the proposal) to count the votes for a specific proposal. 
The proposal's result is determined based on the majority of "yes" or "no" votes.

Proposal Information Retrieval: Users can retrieve information about a specific proposal using various getter functions, such as 
getProposalVotes, getVoteStatus, getResult, and getProposalDetails. These functions allow users to query the voting results, the status of 
individual votes, and the overall status of a proposal (open or closed).

In summary, this smart contract extends the functionality of the previous version by integrating an ERC-20 token for voting. It provides a 
more advanced and flexible way of conducting decentralized votes, where users must stake a specific token to participate in the 
decision-making process. This can be useful in various decentralized governance scenarios, such as DAOs, where token holders use their 
tokens to influence decisions within the organization.
